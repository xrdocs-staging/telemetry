# Introduction

In this article, let’s look at some of the data that I found interesting to stream using Model-Driven Telemetry at the beginning of my SRv6 journey.

# Leveraging Streaming Telemetry for SRv6

The networks of today widely differs between the domains. The end-to-end provisioning is lengthy & complex because of different management teams, manual operations, and heterogeneous underlay/overlay networks. That’s why Segment Routing v6 has been introduced, to provide a scalable, simple, and unified technology for the transport, services and programmability across the Datacenter, Core and Metro domains. It is fully standardized, it solves many design and scalability issues.

##### Provides real-time visibility about SRv6 usage

##### Successful migration

##### Accurate network planning

##### Better understanding of hardware resources mapping
